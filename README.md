# LeetCode Solutions with Tests

This repository contains my solutions to various [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) problems. Each solution is written in TypeScript and includes accompanying tests to verify correctness. The goal is to document my problem-solving journey, improve my coding skills, and understand different approaches to algorithmic challenges.

## Folder Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ easy/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem-name/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts         # Solution implementation
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.test.ts    # Unit tests for the solution
â”œâ”€â”€ medium/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem-name/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts         # Solution implementation
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.test.ts    # Unit tests for the solution
â”œâ”€â”€ hard/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ problem-name/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts         # Solution implementation
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ index.test.ts    # Unit tests for the solution
```

- **`easy/`**, **`medium/`**, and **`hard/`**: These directories categorize problems by difficulty level.
- **Problem Name Folders**: Each problem has its own folder named after the problem or a brief description.
- **Files**:
  - `index.ts`: Contains the solution for the problem.
  - `index.test.ts`: Contains unit tests to validate the solution.

## Approach to Problem-Solving

1. I attempt to solve problems independently and document my solutions.
2. When stuck, I refer to solutions and try to fully understand the approach before implementing it myself.
3. I write unit tests for every solution to ensure correctness and edge-case handling.

## Running the Tests

To run the tests locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:kulembetov/leetcode-problems.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   yarn test
   ```

## Acknowledgments

This repository is a personal learning project. Some solutions might be inspired by others or adapted from existing explanations, which I strive to understand and implement in my own way.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
